## Official Docs

[Here's](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/home.htm) a link to official documentation, [a link to summarization docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/summarize-models.htm#summarize) (if you're particularly interested in Summary models), and [a link to available generation models](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/generate-models.htm).

These are all docs I needed to write my scripts and get it all working.

Enjoy!
